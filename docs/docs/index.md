# Introduction

Welcome to the **Edgeforge** documentation!

This site brings together all the moving parts of Edgeforge Labs — projects, tools, and ideas built around edge computing. Whether you're hacking on edge clusters, writing custom automation, or just exploring what's possible with minimal hardware and maximal creativity, you're in the right place.

## Projects

- **edgectl** – A Golang CLI to automate and manage edge nodes and infrastructure. Built to be portable, `edgectl` works great both interactively and as part of automated workflows.

- **edgecloud** – A scalable edge-cloud platform designed for small form factor devices like SBCs. It's about bringing cloud-native patterns to the edge in a way that feels simple and powerful.
